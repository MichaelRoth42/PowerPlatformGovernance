### 1. Avoid Unethical Prompting

You should not submit prompts that may lead to harmful, biased, or misleading content.

Avoid prompts that:
- Evaluate the behavior or performance of an individual or group
- Identify sentiment, and/or emotions of any individual
- Refer to protected groups (e.g., gender, ethnic groups)
- Ask about illegal or unethical matters
- Ask that third-party content be incorporated into the output
- Include references like “based on” or “in the style” of particular authors or works
- Edit or create images about other individuals

### 2. Use in Teams Meetings Appropriately

Do not use in meetings involving:
- Matters related to someone's sensitive personal data or private information (e.g., health, political beliefs)
- Corporate investigations, litigation, or disputes
- Other legal or compliance topics (unless requested by a legal counsel in the meeting)
- HR processes or procedures about a specific person or group (e.g., performance evaluations)
- Candidate interviews
- Client matters and data not approved by account Senior Leadership
- Small groups like 1:1 meetings unless between Executives only

### 3. Avoid Using Copilot for Private Purposes

Since Copilot for M365 queries information within corporate M365 applications, our organization's or client data may be automatically pulled into a response.

You may only use Copilot for limited private purposes if you can ensure Copilot is not using organization's or client data when creating content.

**To prevent Copilot from sourcing your private files:**
1. Create a folder for personal files locally on your computer:
    - Start / File Explorer / Windows (C:) / New Folder
    - Name the folder ‘Private’
2. Files saved in this folder will not be backed up.

*Note*: Private files and emails on devices should be kept separate from organization's and Client data.

### 4. Confirm Use in Client Engagements

For client engagements, confirm with Management that Copilot for M365 is allowed to be used for client-related work. There may be contractual restrictions (e.g., restrictions on technology use or location of client data).

---

### 5. Use Sensitivity Labels & Check Permissions

Sensitivity labels may not automatically carry over from the source document when copying output from Copilot for M365 into another document.

- Manually apply the applicable sensitivity label to content generated.
- Apply permissions to restrict access to files and emails to those with a business need.

**Before you share, ask:**
- Do I have permission to forward or share this information?
- Should I be sharing this information?

**To check and manage access:**
1. Click on Share.
2. Select Manage Access.
3. Remove users, groups, or links that no longer require access.

---

### 6. Avoid Untested Live Demos

If demoing Copilot for M365, verify the content of documents, emails, or chats that Copilot will query to avoid exposing proprietary, confidential, or restricted information during the demo.

---

### 7. Check for Accuracy and Bias

Ensure accuracy by asking Copilot for M365 to cite sources and reference specific files. 

- Be vigilant for toxic or biased outputs and discard them.
- Report any problematic content to RandomMail@somewhere.com.

---

### 8. Be Transparent

- Do not hide the use of Copilot. Transparency is key to maintaining trust.
- Inform others and allow objections before using Copilot in meetings.
- Label content created by Copilot if you haven’t materially changed it.

---

### Before You Start Using Copilot for M365

Get your information ready:
- Review sensitivity labels and share settings for files, Teams, and SharePoint sites.
- Delete old or unnecessary data.
- Obtain confirmation from the CAL to use Copilot for client engagement.
- Store private files on your Windows (C:) drive to avoid access from Copilot.

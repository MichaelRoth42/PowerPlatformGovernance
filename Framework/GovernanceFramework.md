# Power Platform Governance Framework

## **1. Introduction**

### **1.1 Purpose**
This document serves as a **comprehensive governance framework** for Power Platform, ensuring secure, compliant, and scalable usage across the organization. It defines roles, policies, security controls, and best practices for managing Power Platform environments efficiently.

### **1.2 Scope**
The framework applies to all **Power Platform services** within the organization, including:

- **Power Apps**
- **Power Automate**
- **Power Pages**
- **Copilot Studio**
- **Dataverse**

It covers governance from **tenant-wide administration** to **individual environment management**, aligning with security, compliance, and operational best practices.

### **1.3 Governance Objectives**
- Maintain **security and compliance** across all environments
- Ensure **efficient management** of resources, users, and applications
- Define **roles, responsibilities, and approval processes**
- Implement **access control and periodic reviews**
- Establish **audit-ready policies** for IT security teams

---

## **2. Governance Model Overview**

### **2.1 Power Platform Architecture & Environments**
Power Platform is structured into multiple **environments**, each serving different business needs:

- **Default Environment** – Open for all users, limited governance.
- **Sandbox Environments** – Used for development and testing.
- **Production Environments** – Managed for live business applications.
- **Restricted Environments** – High-security areas for sensitive data.

This section is intended for a high-level overview. For a complete list of environment types, refer to **Microsoft's official documentation**.

> **[ADMIN INPUT REQUIRED]** Provide a description and a visual overview of the environment strategy.

## **4. Access Control & Security Processes**

### **4.1 Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**
Power Platform follows **RBAC principles** to restrict user access based on responsibilities.

### **4.2 Access Request & Approval Process**
This process ensures that all user access requests are **properly reviewed and approved** before being granted.

#### **Access Request Process**
| Step | Action | Responsible Role |
| ---- | --------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| 1    | User submits an access request via IT Service Portal | Requesting User |
| 2    | Environment Admin reviews the request | Environment Admin |
| 3    | Security Officer evaluates for compliance | Security Officer |
| 4    | Access is granted or denied, and logged for auditability | IT Governance Team |

### **4.3 Periodic Access Reviews**
- **Quarterly audits** ensure compliance with **least privilege access principles**.
- **Automated reports** highlight unused or unauthorized roles.
- **Revocation of dormant accounts after [DEFINE TIME FRAME]**.

### **4.4 Data Classification & Risk Assessment in Access Requests**
When requesting access, users must declare the type of data they will handle.

| **Data Classification** | **Description** | **Examples** | **Approval Required By** |
|------------------------|----------------|-------------|------------------------|
| **Public** | No sensitive data, open for broad access | General reports, marketing materials | **Environment Admin** |
| **Internal** | Company-specific but not critical | Project documentation, internal dashboards | **Environment Admin & Business Owner** |

| 5    | If approved, DLP policy is adjusted and monitored | Tenant Admin |

### **4.8 Custom Connector Approval Process**
Custom connectors can pose **security risks**, so they must be **thoroughly reviewed**.

| Step | Action | Responsible Role |
| ---- | --------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| 1    | Maker requests a development environment for testing | Requesting User |
| 2    | Environment Admin grants access to a sandbox environment | Environment Admin |

| 4    | Governance improvements and corrective actions are implemented | IT Governance Team |
| 5    | If required, regulatory reports are submitted to external auditors | Compliance Team |

### **4.11 Default Environment Cleanup Process**
The **Default Environment** is open to all users, which can lead to **cluttered and insecure environments**.

#### **Why a Cleanup Process is Necessary**
- **Prevents clutter** – Ensures only relevant, active apps and flows remain.
- **Reduces security risks** – Unused apps can become security vulnerabilities.
- **Enhances governance** – Helps maintain an organized, well-documented environment.

#### **Hybrid Cleanup Approach: Automation & Manual Review**
- **Automated Weekly Cleanup Check** – A Power Automate Flow or other automation flags **inactive apps, orphaned flows, and unused resources**.  
- **Quarterly Admin-Led Cleanup** – Environment Admins **review flagged items, confirm with business users, and remove what’s unnecessary**.

#### **Cleanup Process**
| Step | Action | Responsible Role |
| ---- | --------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| 1    | Automated system flags **inactive apps, flows, and orphaned resources** | IT Governance Team |
| 2    | Weekly report sent to **Environment Admins** listing flagged items | IT Governance Team |
| 3    | Environment Admins review flagged items and consult business users | Environment Admin |
| 4    | If confirmed unused, items are marked for deletion | Environment Admin |
| 5    | Tenant Admin reviews and approves final deletions | Tenant Admin |
| 6    | Resources are removed, and cleanup is logged for audit tracking | IT Governance Team |
| 7    | Quarterly review ensures cleanup remains effective | IT Governance Team |
